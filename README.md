Generate C# Core Classes from JSON Input

# Proted from Json2CSharpCodeGenerator
The project [Json2CSharpCodeGenerator](https://github.com/Json2CSharp/Json2CSharpCodeGenerator/) needed mono and uses WinForm which doesn't work on mono64 (Mac M1).

# Why
With the use of .NET Core this app runs a Blazor frontend on top of the ported code to (locally/privacy or remote) convert JSON into C#.
